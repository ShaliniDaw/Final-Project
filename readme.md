# Final Project: Muscle Stem Cell Behavior Analysis

This repository contains the complete computational pipeline developed for the MSc Data Science Final Project, focusing on quantitative analysis of muscle stem cell (muSC) migration and morphodynamics from two-dimensional time-lapse imaging data.

The codebase implements trajectory-level feature extraction, diffusion and spatial modelling, morphodynamic analysis, statistical comparison, and robustness validation, supporting the analyses presented in the accompanying dissertation.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaliniDaw/Final-Project.git
   cd Final-Project
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Primary Analysis Notebook

Open CellBehaviour_Modelling_and_Analysis.ipynb in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells sequentially.

The notebook is organised into numbered sections corresponding to major analytical stages:

- Data ingestion, inspection, and tracking
- Migration and trajectory feature extraction
- Diffusion and anomalous transport modelling
- Shape and morphodynamic analysis
- Temporal and injury-context analysis
- Predictive modelling and feature importance
- Export of figures and data tables

All primary results used in the dissertation are generated by this notebook and saved to the Outputs/ directory.

### 2.Run the Robustness and Validation Notebook

After completing the primary analysis, open and run StatisticalRobustness.ipynb.

This notebook:

- Audits missingness and feature distributions
- Evaluates sensitivity to statistical assumptions
- Applies group-aware cross-validation strategies
- Assesses stability of predictive feature importance

No new biological modelling is introduced at this stage; all inputs are fixed artefacts generated by the primary notebook.
Outputs from this notebook are saved to the Outputs_Addendum/ directory.

## Output Files

   - CSV files: extracted features, diffusion parameters, statistical test results, modelling summaries, and robustness diagnostics
   - PNG files: publication-ready figures, overlays, and supplementary visualisations

Each output file can be cross-referenced with the dissertation appendices.

## Reproducibility

- The notebook and script include section headers and comments explaining each analytical step.
- Clear naming conventions for exported files ensure traceability between code and report.

## Professional & Ethical Notes

- Data used are anonymized and pre-segmented; no human or personal data are involved.
- Analysis adheres to BCS and IET codes of conduct, with transparent documentation and sustainable computing practices.
