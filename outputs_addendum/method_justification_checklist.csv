Log1p transformation of skewed features,"Many per-track metrics showed strong positive skew and heavy tails. Log1p stabilizes variance while preserving zero values, improving comparability and interpretability.",No transform; Box–Cox (requires strictly positive data),Monotonic transform preserves rank ordering,Does not guarantee normality; interpretation shifts to log scale
Use of nonparametric tests (e.g. Mann–Whitney U) for group comparisons,Preliminary inspection showed non-Gaussian distributions and unequal variances. Rank-based tests avoid parametric assumptions under these conditions.,Two-sample t-test; Welch’s t-test,Independence; ordinal comparability,Sensitive only to monotone differences; reduced power under normality
Group-aware cross-validation by video stack,Tracks from the same video are not statistically independent. GroupKFold prevents information leakage across folds.,Standard StratifiedKFold,Stack-level grouping captures dominant dependence structure,Higher variance; fewer effective folds
Permutation importance under group-aware CV,Permutation importance evaluates feature contribution without assuming linearity and reflects performance sensitivity under realistic validation.,Model coefficients; impurity-based importance,Feature perturbation reflects information content,Unstable with correlated features; fold-dependent variability
Logistic regression as baseline classifier,Provides a transparent linear baseline with interpretable coefficients and stable optimization under high-dimensional features.,Tree ensembles; kernel classifiers,Approximate linear separability in feature space,Limited capacity for complex nonlinear interactions
